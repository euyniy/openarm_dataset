# OpenArm Dataset

## Quick start

### Install

```bash
pip install openarm_dataset
```

### Sample usage

Basic:

```python
>>> import openarm_dataset
>>> dataset = openarm_dataset.Dataset("tests/fixture/dataset_0.3.0")
>>> dataset.meta.episodes
[{'id': '0', 'success': False, 'task_index': 0}, {'id': '3', 'success': True, 'task_index': 0}]
>>> dataset.meta.tasks
[{'prompt': 'Run test.', 'description': 'Longer task description if need.'}]
>>> dataset.num_episodes
2
```

Obs/Action:

```python
>>> obs = dataset.load_obs(0)
>>> list(obs.keys())
['arms/right/qpos', 'arms/right/qvel', 'arms/right/qtorque', 'arms/left/qpos', 'arms/left/qvel', 'arms/left/qtorque', 'lifter/elevation']
>>> obs["arms/right/qpos"].shape
(746, 8)
>>> obs["arms/right/qpos"].head(2)
                                 joint1    joint2    joint3    joint4    joint5    joint6    joint7   gripper

2026-02-25 09:04:11.618732974 -0.039352  0.989118 -0.051771  0.735691  0.077740 -0.070724  0.079488 -0.124674

>>> action = dataset.load_action(0, use_unixtime=True)
>>> list(action.keys())
['arms/right/qpos', 'arms/left/qpos', 'lifter/elevation']
>>> action["arms/right/qpos"].shape
(90, 8)
```

The available keys reflect what was actually recorded: arm data may contain any
of `qpos`/`qvel`/`qtorque`/`pose`, and embodiments whose files were not
recorded (e.g. a declared but unused lifter) are simply absent. Datasets
recorded with Cartesian teleoperation expose an 8-dim `pose` action
(position + quaternion + gripper) instead of `qpos`:

```python
>>> dataset = openarm_dataset.Dataset("tests/fixture/dataset_0.4.0_pose")
>>> action = dataset.load_action(0)
>>> list(action.keys())
['arms/right/pose', 'arms/left/pose', 'lifter/elevation']
>>> list(action["arms/right/pose"].columns)
['x', 'y', 'z', 'qw', 'qx', 'qy', 'qz', 'gripper']
```

The dataset itself only ever stores the raw recorded representation. To use a
specific representation, pass `state=` to `load_obs`/`load_action`/`sample`:
recorded data matching the request is returned as-is, and anything else is
converted on the fly with
[openarm_control](https://github.com/enactic/openarm_control) kinematics —
`qpos` to `pose` via FK, `pose` to `qpos` via IK (seeded from the episode's
recorded obs qpos and tracked along the pose trajectory; a warning reports
samples where the solver failed or did not converge). `rot6d`
(position + the first two rotation matrix columns + gripper, 10-dim) is
derived from the pose:

```python
>>> action = dataset.load_action(0, state="qpos")  # IK from the recorded pose
>>> list(action.keys())
['arms/right/qpos', 'arms/left/qpos', 'lifter/elevation']
>>> obs = dataset.load_obs(0, state="rot6d")       # FK, then 6D rotation
>>> list(obs["arms/right/rot6d"].columns)
['x', 'y', 'z', 'r11', 'r21', 'r31', 'r12', 'r22', 'r32', 'gripper']
```

Recorded `pose` data must be end-effector poses in the MuJoCo model's world
frame (the openarm_control Cartesian-teleop convention); the kinematics use
the model at its home keyframe, and time-varying lifter elevation is not
folded in. The IK runs with openarm_control's real-time teleoperation
shaping (bounded per-solve motion, singularity braking, nullspace home
regulation) disabled so that every recorded pose is solved to convergence.
Pass `kinematics=` to `Dataset` to override the engines built with
`openarm_dataset.kinematics.create_engines()` (e.g. for a different scene
or IK tolerances).

Camera:

```python
>>> cameras = dataset.load_cameras(0)
>>> list(cameras.keys())
['wrist_left', 'wrist_right', 'ceiling', 'head']
>>> cam_head = cameras["head"]
>>> cam_head.num_frames
3
>>> cam_head.load_timestamps()
[1772010251.6187909, 1772010251.629775, 1772010251.6634612]
>>> frame = cam_head.get_frame(0)
>>> frame.timestamp
1772010251.6187909
>>> frame.path
PosixPath('.../head/1772010251618790832.jpeg')
>>> frame.load().shape
(600, 960, 3)
>>> for frame in cam_head.frames():
...     pass  # iterate over Frame objects
```

A camera's frames may be stored either as individual timestamped JPEG files in a
directory (`episodes/0/cameras/head/<timestamp>.jpeg`) or packed into a single
uncompressed tar archive (`episodes/0/cameras/head.tar`). Packing keeps the file
count low enough for [Hugging Face Hub's storage
recommendations](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/storage-limits#recommendations).
Both layouts expose the same API shown above. For tar-backed cameras, `frame.path`
is a synthetic `.../head.tar/<timestamp>.jpeg` path that locates the image inside
the archive — it is not a real file, so use `frame.load()` or `frame.read_bytes()`
to access the image data.

Sampling:

```python
>>> samples = dataset.sample(hz=30, episode_index=0)
>>> samples
[Sample(timestamp=1772010251.6202147), Sample(timestamp=1772010251.653548)]
>>> samples[0].timestamp
1772010251.6202147
>>> samples[0].obs["arms/right/qpos"]
array([-0.0393523 ,  0.9891182 , -0.05177076,  0.7356907 ,  0.07774002,
       -0.07072392,  0.07948788, -0.1246737 ], dtype=float32)
>>> samples[0].action["arms/right/qpos"]
array([ 0.03098021,  0.991799  , -0.16657865,  0.96951085,  0.01440866,
        0.14349142, -0.18980259,  0.08221525], dtype=float32)
>>> {name: frame.load().shape for name, frame in samples[0].cameras.items()}
{'wrist_left': (600, 960, 3), 'wrist_right': (600, 960, 3), 'ceiling': (600, 960, 3), 'head': (600, 960, 3)}
```

## Dataset format (v0.4.0)

The current on-disk format written by `Dataset.write()` (and by the
`dora-openarm-dataset-recorder`):

```
<root>/
  metadata.yaml                      # version: "0.4.0"
  episodes/<id>/
    obs/arms/<side>/state.parquet    # timestamp + any of qpos/qvel/qtorque/pose
    action/arms/<side>/state.parquet # timestamp + qpos or pose
    obs/lifter/elevation.parquet     # timestamp + value (only if recorded)
    action/lifter/elevation.parquet  # timestamp + value (only if recorded)
    cameras/<name>/<timestamp>.jpeg  # or cameras/<name>.tar
```

`state.parquet` is self-describing: its non-timestamp columns (each a list of
floats per frame) define the available attributes. `qpos`/`qvel`/`qtorque`
have one entry per joint; `pose` is 8-dim
(`x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz, gripper`). Older formats (0.1.0–0.3.0 and
unversioned) are still read transparently, and `Dataset.write()` always
produces v0.4.0.

## Command-line tools

Validate a dataset:

```bash
openarm-dataset-validate <input> \
    [--no-update-metadata]         # do not record per-episode validity in the metadata
    [--qpos-jump-threshold RADIAN] # default 1.0
    [--qpos-absmax RADIAN]         # default 6.28
    [--min-duration SECOND]        # default 2.0
    [--max-duration SECOND]        # default none (disabled)
    [--max-stream-desync SECOND]   # default 1.0
    [--max-sample-gap SECOND]      # default 1.0
```

Every episode is checked for `null` and `NaN` values, and for having any `obs`
and `action` data at all: an episode whose parquet files are missing entirely
(a camera-only recording, say) is reported as `no obs data` / `no action data`,
since every other check would otherwise pass it silently. Presence is judged by
what the episode recorded, not by `equipment.embodiments`, so an embodiment
that is declared but never recorded is not an error.

`--max-stream-desync` and `--max-sample-gap` catch an arm that stops reporting
mid-recording. All of an episode's streams are recorded in one window, so
`--max-stream-desync` flags an episode whose streams do not all cover the same
span of time — feedback that dropped and never came back leaves `obs` ending
while the cameras and `action` run on — and `--max-sample-gap` flags a stream
that stops and resumes, which keeps the span intact but leaves a hole in the
middle. Neither is visible file by file: each parquet is complete and free of
`null`. The duration checks do not see it either, since they measure `obs` and
so report a truncated stream as a short episode rather than a broken one.

In addition, `--qpos-absmax` flags `qpos` values whose absolute value exceeds
the threshold, `--qpos-jump-threshold` flags `qpos` frame-to-frame deltas above
the threshold as abrupt jumps, and `--min-duration` / `--max-duration` flag
episodes shorter or longer than the given duration. The thresholds are checked
against the recorded values (smoothing is not applied) and each is disabled by
passing `none`, e.g. `--min-duration none`; `--max-duration` is disabled unless
given. Files that include `null` or `NaN` are reported but not checked against
the `qpos` thresholds.

Exits with status `1` if any errors are reported. The result is also recorded
per episode as a boolean `valid` flag in `metadata.yaml` unless
`--no-update-metadata` is given. Recording is not supported for unversioned
datasets. Episodes marked `valid: false` can be excluded from conversion with
`openarm-dataset-convert --valid-only`.

Repair a dataset:

```bash
openarm-dataset-repair <input> \
    [-o <output>]    # write the repaired dataset here; repairs in place if omitted
```

Fills isolated single-frame gaps (a `null` or `NaN` in a `qpos`/`qvel`/
`qtorque`/`pose`/`value` array) by averaging the immediately preceding and following
frame values, per array element. Gaps spanning two or more consecutive frames,
and gaps at the first or last frame, cannot be averaged and are left untouched
with a warning on stderr. The command always exits with status `0`; run
`openarm-dataset-validate` afterwards to confirm the result.

Merge multiple datasets:

```bash
openarm-dataset-merge <input1> <input2> [<input3> ...] \
    -o <output>    \
    [--symlink]    # create symlinks instead of copying episode data
```

All input datasets must have the same version, equipment, and frequencies.
Tasks are deduplicated by prompt: identical prompts are treated as the same
task. Episodes are renumbered sequentially starting from 0.

Convert a dataset:

```bash
openarm-dataset-convert <input> <output> \
    [--format {openarm,lerobot_v2.1,lerobot_v3.0,gr00t}] \
    [--camera-format {dir,tar}] # default dir (openarm only); tar packs each \
                                # camera into one .tar archive \
    [--fps INT]                # default 30 (lerobot/gr00t only) \
    [--smoothing-cutoff FLOAT] # default 1.0 (lerobot/gr00t only) \
    [--train-split FLOAT]      # default 0.8 (lerobot/gr00t only) \
    [--success-only]           # lerobot/gr00t only \
    [--valid-only]             # exclude episodes marked invalid \
    [--state {qpos,pose,rot6d}] # default qpos (lerobot/gr00t only)
```

The `--fps`, `--smoothing-cutoff`, `--train-split`, `--success-only`, and
`--state` flags apply only when `--format lerobot_v2.1`, `--format
lerobot_v3.0`, or `--format gr00t`.
The `--valid-only` flag applies to every output format and excludes episodes
marked `valid: false` by `openarm-dataset-validate`; episodes without the
flag are treated as valid. If no episode has a `valid` flag (i.e. the dataset
has not been validated yet), a warning is printed on stderr and nothing is
excluded.
The `gr00t` format produces a LeRobot v2.1 dataset plus a GR00T-compatible
`meta/modality.json` (see [Isaac-GR00T data preparation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/blob/main/getting_started/data_preparation.md)).

`--state` selects the arm state representation of the LeRobot output
(default: `qpos`), converting on the fly (see the `state=` API above) when
the dataset stores the other representation. Every arm stream is exported
in this one representation, regardless of what was recorded.
The converted values are only written to the LeRobot output; the OpenArm
dataset itself always keeps the raw recorded data.

Upload a dataset to the Hugging Face Hub:

```bash
openarm-dataset-upload <input> \
    --repo-id <user>/<dataset> \
    [--private]                # create the repo as private if it does not exist
```

The whole dataset directory is uploaded to a
[dataset repository](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets), creating it if it
does not already exist, and tagged with the dataset version. Cameras stored as
directories of JPEG files are repacked **in place** into one `.tar` archive per
camera before uploading, to stay within [Hugging Face Hub's file-count
recommendations](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/storage-limits#recommendations).
Repacking is lossless and reversible (`openarm-dataset-convert --camera-format dir`
restores the JPEG-directory layout).
